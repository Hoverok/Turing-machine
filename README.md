# Turing-machine
A fully working Turing machine.
Beginning state is always 0.
This program holds the logic and requires a text file with:
head starting location,
a tape,
a finite table of instructions.
There are 4 files in the repository for 4 different situations:
1 runs and completes the program;
2 and 3 run the program until they try going out of tape's bounds and then are forced to stop;
4 is an endless loop that can be stopped by pressing the "esc" button.
Has error handing and checks users input for faulty inputs.
This project was a university assignment.
