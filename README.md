# Turing-machine
A fully working Turing machine.
//beginning state is always 0
//this program holds the logic and requires a text file with:
//head starting location
//a tape
//a finite table of instructions
//there are 4 files in the repository for 4 different situations
//1 runs and completes the program
//2 and 3 run the program until they try going out of tape's bounds and then are forced to stop
//4 is an endless loop that can be stopped by pressing the "esc" button

//this is a project I did as a university assignment
